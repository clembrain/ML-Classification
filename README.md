## 🧠 Abstract

This project leverages **supervised machine learning classification techniques** to predict whether a customer will subscribe to a term deposit during a Portuguese bank's telemarketing campaign. Using publicly available data from the UCI Machine Learning Repository, the aim is to explore how decision-making can be optimized using AI models like **Random Forest**, **Decision Trees**, and **Boosted Models**.

Key benefits for the bank include:  
- Enhanced targeting of high-potential clients  
- Improved marketing efficiency and ROI  
- Actionable insights on customer behavior

## 📂 Dataset Overview

- **Source:** [UCI Bank Marketing Dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/222/bank+marketing)  
- **Features:** 17 (Categorical & Numerical)  
- **Target:** Binary (`yes` or `no`) — whether a customer subscribed

### 🔑 Variables
- **Demographics:** `age`, `job`, `education`, `marital status`  
- **Campaign Details:** `call duration`, `contact month`, `number of contacts`  
- **Socio-Economic Indicators:** `consumer confidence index`, `employment rate`, `interest rate`

## 🧹 Data Preprocessing

- Categorical Encoding with **One-Hot Encoding**
- Standardization with **StandardScaler**
- Feature selection via **RFECV**
- Class imbalance handled using **Random UnderSampling** and **SMOTE**
